## History

Main articles: [History of New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_City "History of New York City") and [Timeline of New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_New_York_City "Timeline of New York City")

### Etymology

In 1664, the city was named in honor of the [Duke of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York "Duke of York"), who would become King [James II of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England "James II of England"). James's older brother, King [Charles II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England "Charles II of England"), had appointed the Duke [proprietor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_colony "Proprietary colony") of the former territory of [New Netherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland "New Netherland"), including the city of [New Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam "New Amsterdam"), which England had recently seized from the Dutch.[\[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Archdeacon2013a-45)

### Early history

In the [precolonial era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_era "Pre-Columbian era"), the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by [Algonquian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_peoples "Algonquian peoples") Native Americans, including the [Lenape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape "Lenape"). Their homeland, known as [Lenapehoking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenapehoking "Lenapehoking"), included Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of [Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island "Long Island") (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the [Lower Hudson Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Hudson_Valley "Lower Hudson Valley").[\[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-46)

The first documented visit into [New York Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Harbor "New York Harbor") by a European was in 1524 by [Giovanni da Verrazzano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_da_Verrazzano "Giovanni da Verrazzano"), a [Florentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence "Florence") explorer in the service of the [French crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France "Kingdom of France").[\[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Debo2013-47) He claimed the area for France and named it _Nouvelle Angoulême_ ([New Angoulême](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Angoul%C3%AAme "New Angoulême")).[\[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-rodgers-48) A [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire") expedition, led by the [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_people "Portuguese people") captain [Estêvão Gomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est%C3%AAv%C3%A3o_Gomes "Estêvão Gomes") sailing for [Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor"), arrived in [New York Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Harbor "New York Harbor") in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named _Río de San Antonio_ (Saint Anthony's River). The [Padrón Real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padr%C3%B3n_Real "Padrón Real") of 1527, the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and labeled the [northeastern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States "Northeastern United States") as _Tierra de Esteban Gómez_ in his honor.[\[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-49)

In 1609, the English explorer [Henry Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hudson "Henry Hudson") rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the [Northwest Passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Passage "Northwest Passage") to the [Orient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient "Orient") for the [Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company "Dutch East India Company").[\[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Lankevich2002-50) He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the [North River](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_River_(Hudson_River)> "North River (Hudson River)") (now the [Hudson River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River "Hudson River")), named first by Hudson as the _Mauritius_ after [Maurice, Prince of Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice,_Prince_of_Orange "Maurice, Prince of Orange"). Hudson's first mate described the harbor as "a very good Harbour for all windes" and the river as "a mile broad" and "full of fish".[\[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-hudsonnni-51) Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles (240 km) north,[\[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-52) past the site of the present-day New York State [capital city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_capitals "List of U.S. state capitals") of [Albany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York "Albany, New York"), in the belief that it might be an oceanic [tributary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tributary "Tributary") before the river became too shallow to continue.[\[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-hudsonnni-51) He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between [Cape Cod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod "Cape Cod") and [Delaware Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Bay "Delaware Bay") was claimed by the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") and called _Nieuw-Nederland_ ([New Netherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland "New Netherland")).

The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was [Juan Rodriguez](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_(Jan)_Rodriguez> "Juan (Jan) Rodriguez") ([transliterated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration "Transliteration") to Dutch as _Jan Rodrigues_), a merchant from [Santo Domingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captaincy_General_of_Santo_Domingo "Captaincy General of Santo Domingo"). Born in [Santo Domingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Domingo "Santo Domingo") of [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_people "Portuguese people") and [African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa "Ethnic groups of Africa") descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. [Broadway](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(Manhattan)> "Broadway (Manhattan)"), from 159th Street to 218th Street in [Upper Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Manhattan "Upper Manhattan"), is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.[\[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-53)[\[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-54)

### Dutch rule

[![A pen drawing of two men in 17th-century Dutch clothing presenting an open box of items to a group of Native Americans in feather headdresses stereotypical of plains tribes.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/The_Purchase_of_Manhattan_Island.png/220px-The_Purchase_of_Manhattan_Island.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Purchase_of_Manhattan_Island.png)

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Purchase_of_Manhattan_Island.png "Enlarge")

[Peter Minuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Minuit "Peter Minuit") is credited with the purchase of the island of Manhattan in 1626.

A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624—making New York the 12th [oldest continuously occupied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_cities_by_year_of_foundation "List of North American cities by year of foundation") European-established settlement in the [continental United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_United_States "Continental United States")[\[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-55)—with the founding of a Dutch [fur trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_trade "Fur trade") settlement on [Governors Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governors_Island "Governors Island"). In 1625, construction was started on a [citadel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel "Citadel") and [Fort Amsterdam](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Amsterdam_(New_Amsterdam)> "Fort Amsterdam (New Amsterdam)"), later called _Nieuw Amsterdam_ (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.[\[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-56)[\[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Tolerance-57) The colony of New Amsterdam was centered on what would later be known as Lower Manhattan. It extended from the lower tip of Manhattan to modern day [Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street "Wall Street"), where a 12-foot wooden [stockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockade "Stockade") was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and British raids.[\[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-58) In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General [Peter Minuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Minuit "Peter Minuit"), acting as charged by the [Dutch West India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_West_India_Company "Dutch West India Company"), purchased the island of Manhattan from the _Canarsie_, a small Lenape band,[\[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-59) for "the value of 60 [guilders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_guilder "Dutch guilder")"[\[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-60) (about $900 in 2018).[\[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-61) A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[\[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-62)[\[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-63)

Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[\[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-npsnetherland-64) To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the [patroon system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patroon "Patroon") in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (_patroons_, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[\[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-locnetherland-65)

Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a [monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly "Monopoly") in New Netherland, on authority granted by the [Dutch States General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_General_of_the_Netherlands "States General of the Netherlands"). In 1639–1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the [Dutch West Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_Antilles "Netherlands Antilles")).[\[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-npsnetherland-64)[\[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-nahcnetherland-66)

In 1647, [Peter Stuyvesant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stuyvesant "Peter Stuyvesant") began his tenure as the last [Director-General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director-General_of_New_Amsterdam "Director-General of New Amsterdam") of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[\[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-67)[\[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-68) Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the [Dutch Reformed Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Reformed_Church "Dutch Reformed Church"), and blocked other religious groups (including [Quakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers "Quakers"), [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews"), and [Lutherans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism "Lutheranism")) from establishing houses of worship.[\[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-nyhsstuyvesant-69) The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam.[\[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-nnistuyvesant-70)

### English rule

[![A painting of a coastline dotted with red roof houses and a windmill, with several masted ships sailing close to shore under blue sky.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg/220px-GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg)

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg "Enlarge")

[New Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam "New Amsterdam"), centered in the eventual [Lower Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan "Lower Manhattan"), in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it "New York".

In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel [Richard Nicolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nicolls "Richard Nicolls"), without bloodshed.[\[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-nyhsstuyvesant-69)[\[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-nnistuyvesant-70) The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[\[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-lehrmanstuyvesant-71) The English promptly renamed the fledgling city "New York" after the [Duke of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England "James II of England") (the future King James II of England).[\[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-72) The transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the [Treaty of Breda](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Breda_(1667)> "Treaty of Breda (1667)"), which concluded the [Second Anglo-Dutch War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anglo-Dutch_War "Second Anglo-Dutch War").[\[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-73)

On August 24, 1673, during the [Third Anglo-Dutch War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Dutch_War "Third Anglo-Dutch War"), Dutch captain [Anthony Colve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Colve "Anthony Colve") seized the colony of New York from England at the behest of [Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelis_Evertsen_the_Youngest "Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest") and rechristened it "New Orange" after [William III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England "William III of England"), the [Prince of Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Orange "Prince of Orange").[\[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Roper2017-74) The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the [Treaty of Westminster](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Westminster_(1674)> "Treaty of Westminster (1674)") of November 1674.[\[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-75)[\[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-76)

Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some [epidemics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic "Epidemic") brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.[\[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-77) By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.[\[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-78) New York experienced several [yellow fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever "Yellow fever") epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone.[\[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-79)[\[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-80)

### British colony

[![A painting of a ship firing its cannons in a harbor.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/A_view_of_Fort_George_with_the_city_of_New_York%2C_from_the_SW.jpg/220px-A_view_of_Fort_George_with_the_city_of_New_York%2C_from_the_SW.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_view_of_Fort_George_with_the_city_of_New_York,_from_the_SW.jpg)

[Fort George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Amsterdam "Fort Amsterdam") and the City of New York c. 1731. [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people "British people") maritime forces are seen guarding what would become [New York Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Harbor "New York Harbor").

New York grew in importance as a trading port while under [British rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") in the early 1700s.[\[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Foote2004-81) It also became a center of [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery"), with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, the highest percentage outside [Charleston, South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina "Charleston, South Carolina").[\[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-82) Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the [American South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States"). Discovery of the [African Burying Ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Burying_Ground "African Burying Ground") in the 1990s, during construction of a new [federal courthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States "Federal judiciary of the United States") near [Foley Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_Square "Foley Square"), revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.[\[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-AsanteMazama2005-83)

The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of [John Peter Zenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peter_Zenger "John Peter Zenger"), who had been accused of [seditious libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seditious_libel "Seditious libel") after criticizing colonial governor [William Cosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cosby "William Cosby"), helped to establish the [freedom of the press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press "Freedom of the press") in North America.[\[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-zenger-84) In 1754, [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") was founded under charter by [King George II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain "George II of Great Britain") as King's College in Lower Manhattan.[\[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-85)

### American Revolution

The [Stamp Act Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_Congress "Stamp Act Congress") met in New York in October 1765, as the [Sons of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Liberty "Sons of Liberty"), organized in the city, [skirmished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirmisher "Skirmisher") over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.[\[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-BoyerClark2009-86) The [Battle of Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island "Battle of Long Island"), the largest battle of the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War"), was fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn.[\[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Reno2008-87) After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for [Loyalist](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution)> "Loyalist (American Revolution)") refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces [evacuated](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuation_Day_(New_York)> "Evacuation Day (New York)") at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 [freedmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedmen "Freedmen") for resettlement in [Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia "Nova Scotia").[\[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Hinks2007-88) They resettled other [freedmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman "Freedman") in England and the [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean").

The [Battle of Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island "Battle of Long Island"), the largest battle of the [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution"), took place in [Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn "Brooklyn") in 1776.

The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the [Conference House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_House "Conference House") on Staten Island between American delegates, including [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin"), and British general [Lord Howe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Howe,_1st_Earl_Howe "Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe") on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the [Great Fire of New York](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_New_York_(1776)> "Great Fire of New York (1776)") occurred, a large conflagration on the [West Side](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_(Manhattan)> "West Side (Manhattan)") of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including [Trinity Church](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Church_(New_York_City)> "Trinity Church (New York City)").[\[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-89)

In 1785, the assembly of the [Congress of the Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation "Congress of the Confederation") made New York City the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation "Articles of Confederation") and the first capital under the [Constitution of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution "United States Constitution"). In 1789, the first President of the United States, [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington"), was inaugurated; the first [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") and the [Supreme Court of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "Supreme Court of the United States") each assembled for the first time, and the [United States Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights "United States Bill of Rights") was drafted, all at [Federal Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Hall "Federal Hall") on Wall Street.[\[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-90) By 1790, New York had surpassed [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia") to become the largest city in the United States, but by the end of that year, pursuant to the [Residence Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_Act "Residence Act"), the national capital was moved to Philadelphia.[\[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-residence_act-91)[\[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-92)

Over the course of the nineteenth century, New York City's population grew from \~60,000 to \~3.43 million.[\[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-94) Under New York State's [abolition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_slavery_in_the_United_States "Abolition of slavery in the United States") act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in [indentured servitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servitude "Indentured servitude") until their mid-to-late twenties.[\[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-95)[\[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-96) Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential [United States founders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "Founding Fathers of the United States") as [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton "Alexander Hamilton") and [John Jay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay "John Jay"), the [New York Manumission Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Manumission_Society "New York Manumission Society") worked for abolition and established the [African Free School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Free_School "African Free School") to educate black children.[\[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Divided-97) It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. The city's black population reached more than 16,000 in 1840.[\[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-98)

In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a national and [international trading center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade "International trade"), as well as by European immigration.[\[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-99) The city adopted the [Commissioners' Plan of 1811](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioners%27_Plan_of_1811 "Commissioners' Plan of 1811"), which expanded the city [street grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_plan#Early_United_States "Grid plan") to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the [Erie Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal "Erie Canal") through [central New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_New_York "Central New York") connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the [Hudson River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River "Hudson River") and the [Great Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes "Great Lakes").[\[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-100) Local politics became dominated by [Tammany Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall "Tammany Hall"), a [political machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine "Political machine") supported by [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora "Irish diaspora") and [German immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_diaspora "German diaspora").[\[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-101)

Several prominent American [literary figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer "Writer") lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including [William Cullen Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cullen_Bryant "William Cullen Bryant"), [Washington Irving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving "Washington Irving"), [Herman Melville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville "Herman Melville"), [Rufus Wilmot Griswold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Wilmot_Griswold "Rufus Wilmot Griswold"), [John Keese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keese "John Keese"), [Nathaniel Parker Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Parker_Willis "Nathaniel Parker Willis"), and [Edgar Allan Poe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe "Edgar Allan Poe"). Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of [Central Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park "Central Park"), which in 1857 became the first [landscaped park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_design "Landscape design") in an American city.

The [Great Irish Famine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)> "Great Famine (Ireland)") brought a large influx of Irish immigrants; more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city's population.[\[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-102) There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York's population by 1860.[\[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Harris-103)

[Democratic Party](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)> "Democratic Party (United States)") candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor [Fernando Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Wood "Fernando Wood") called upon the [aldermen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderman "Alderman") to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[\[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Divided-97) Anger at new [military conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_conscription "Military conscription") laws during the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $6,229 in 2019) commutation fee to hire a substitute,[\[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-104) led to the [Draft Riots of 1863](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Draft_Riots "New York Draft Riots"), whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[\[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Divided-97)

The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the [New York Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department "New York City Police Department"), which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants.[\[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Harris-103) At least 120 people were killed.[\[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-McPherson-105) Eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee the city for [Williamsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg,_Brooklyn "Williamsburg, Brooklyn"), Brooklyn, and New Jersey. The black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established dominance.[\[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Harris-103)[\[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-McPherson-105) Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area.[\[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-Harris-103) It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.[\[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-106)

New York City is situated in the [northeastern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States "Northeastern United States"), in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"). The location at the mouth of the [Hudson River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River "Hudson River"), which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of [Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island "Long Island"), Manhattan, and Staten Island.

The [Hudson River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River "Hudson River") flows through the [Hudson Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Valley "Hudson Valley") into [New York Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Bay "New York Bay"). Between New York City and [Troy, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_New_York "Troy, New York"), the river is an [estuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary "Estuary").[\[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-143) The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of [New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey "New Jersey"). The [East River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River "East River")—a [tidal strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_strait "Tidal strait")—flows from [Long Island Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_Sound "Long Island Sound") and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The [Harlem River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_River "Harlem River"), another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The [Bronx River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_River "Bronx River"), which flows through the Bronx and [Westchester County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County "Westchester County"), is the only entirely [fresh water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water "Fresh water") river in the city.[\[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-nytimes-144)

The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable [land reclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reclamation "Land reclamation") along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in [Lower Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan "Lower Manhattan"), with developments such as [Battery Park City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_Park_City "Battery Park City") in the 1970s and 1980s.[\[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-gillespie-p71-145) Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.[\[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-146)

The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2), including 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of this is water.[\[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-CensusGazetteer-147)[\[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-NYT_Land_Estimate-148) The highest point in the city is [Todt Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todt_Hill "Todt Hill") on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) [above sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level "Above mean sea level"), is the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard south of [Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine "Maine").[\[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-149) The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in [woodlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland "Woodland") as part of the [Staten Island Greenbelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island_Greenbelt "Staten Island Greenbelt").[\[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-150)

The five [boroughs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_(New_York_City)> "Borough (New York City)") of New York City:

1. Manhattan

2. Brooklyn

3. Queens

4. The Bronx

5. Staten Island

New York City is sometimes referred to collectively as the five boroughs.

There are [hundreds of distinct neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neighborhoods_in_New_York_City "Category:Neighborhoods in New York City") throughout the boroughs, many with a definable history and character. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten Island would be ranked 37th); these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in the United States: New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), Bronx, and Queens.

#### Manhattan

[Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "Manhattan") (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough, is home to [Central Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park "Central Park") and most of the city's skyscrapers, and is sometimes locally known as _The City_.[\[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-ManhattanTheCity-154)

Manhattan's (New York County's) population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km²) in 2015 makes it the [highest of any county in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_statistics_of_the_United_States#Population_density "County statistics of the United States") and [higher than the density of any individual American city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population_density#New_York_City_boroughs "List of United States cities by population density").[\[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-155) Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and [financial center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_center "Financial center") of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major [multinational corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation "Multinational corporation"), the [United Nations Headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters "United Nations Headquarters"), [Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street "Wall Street"), and a number of important universities. Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.[\[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-156)[\[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#cite_note-157)

Most of the borough is situated on [Manhattan Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Island "Manhattan Island"), at the mouth of the [Hudson River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River "Hudson River"). Several small islands also compose part of the borough of Manhattan, including [Randall's Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall%27s_Island "Randall's Island"), [Wards Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wards_Island "Wards Island"), and [Roosevelt Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Island "Roosevelt Island") in the [East River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River "East River"), and [Governors Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governors_Island "Governors Island") and [Liberty Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Island "Liberty Island") to the south in [New York Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Harbor "New York Harbor"). Manhattan Island is loosely divided into the [Lower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan "Lower Manhattan"), [Midtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan "Midtown Manhattan"), and [Uptown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Manhattan "Upper Manhattan") regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the [Upper East Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Side "Upper East Side") and the [Upper West Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_West_Side "Upper West Side"), and above the park is [Harlem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem "Harlem").

The borough of Manhattan also includes a small neighborhood on the mainland, called [Marble Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Hill,_Manhattan "Marble Hill, Manhattan"), which is contiguous with the Bronx. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the _outer boroughs_.
